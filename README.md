## Assignment 1B Programming exercise
1. Basic implementation of linear regression (using first principles) - 15 points
2. Exploring the effect of different learning rates on convergence - 10 points
3. Implementation of feature scaling, feature standardization and regularization for improved learning - 10 points
4. Data visualization to understand the working of algorithm and other steps (applicable toall the above stages) - 15 points

## Assignment 2 Programming exercise 
1. Basic implementation of neural network trained using back-propagation (15 points)
- Provide clear comments for each sections/phases of your code. eg: If your are initializing the network weights between [0,1] clearly state it in your comments
2. Exploring the effect of different activation functions (eg. linear, sigmoid, tanh and ReLU) (10 points)
-  You are required to implement at least two activation functions and provide visualizations to help understand their impact/use.
3. Exploring the effect of network size on generalizability (eg. number of hidden layers, number of hidden neurons) (10 points)
- You are required to explore at least two options (eg. two hidden layers vs one hidden layer, x neurons vs y neurons in the hidden layer/layers
4. Effective use of data visualization and analysis of the results to understand the working of algorithm and other steps (15 points)
- This is applicable to all the above stages. eg. learning curves, no. of hidden layers/neurons vs convergence, activation functions etc. 5 points will be allocated to each of the above 3 stages.
